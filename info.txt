@agenetics1 i see, what kind of cv scores did you get for K = 5,6,7? when did the score start falling?
@agenetics1 thanks. did you try using onge and no irula and setting it at K = 6?
@agenetics1 btw, what was K set as? 7 ?
@agenetics1 any reason why you didn't use the default genotyping rate of all the samples? and why picked 0.5?
@agenetics1 did you clean the files a bit by changing the --maf ? or just used standard plink files after extracting them?   How many total samples btw?
@Ugrashravas @shrikanth_krish Lmao, why would it? It’s literally occupied by 100s of different sovereign nations. You do realize India is one sovereign nation? Yeah, caste and ethnicities aren’t nations in the actual sense of the term.
@shrikanth_krish @dxrsam_0 In fact that language was so conservative even Shudras kept the pitch accent there. It more or less added up to the later situation where Gandhari Prakrit remained the most conservative of all the Prakrits ever.
@Puer_Hispano No, soy indio y esa mujer también. El hilo no tiene nada que ver con el orientalismo occidental o el exotismo. Esa es tu propia interpretación.

@optimus83030798 @D_Lich_King @VarunKh90848217 “Vedic literature” was created in Punjab. It was Magadha which was seen as the land of aboriginal Asuras, which is why the Satapatha Brahamana makes fun of the speech of people who live there.
Whether you call it Sanskrit or Old-Indo-Aryan is immaterial, they’re one and the same thing. Here’s an excellent thread explaining why you’re wrong and your assumption is very heavy handed.    https://t.co/c3EoLUxIJX
Or perhaps you just don’t know Sanskrit and the history of it’s grammatical tradition that well.   Classical Sanskrit is just the standardized and spoken sociolect of the North Western Brahmins of the time. Other non-Standardized forms of Sanskrit were spoken, almost identical.
@D_Lich_King @VarunKh90848217 If anything, it’s a lot of Jats who migrated from South Punjab &amp; Sindh to the North. You should read Andre Wink’s Making of the Indo-Islamic world for more on this. Khatris and Punjabi Brahmins simply are the direct descendants of the Vedic Aryans of the region.
@D_Lich_King @VarunKh90848217 Mujhe genetics sikhayega tu forum blog posts padh ke ab? 😂   Khatris and Jats have the same AASI, and both of them have low AASI because unlike Gangetics who mixed more with pure aboriginals, they are North Western groups who stayed in the original homeland of the Vedic Aryans.  https://t.co/QjKQbnlB8c
Btw, what idiot thinks any of these posts are “sexualizing” in anyway? They’re modestly dressed women and not an inch of indecent exposure is there. Some people just hate beauty.
@amshyraa That’s not what you said, you said “there’s nothing against LGBTQ” — I never said it’s something very harsh, I just said it’s almost certainly not accepted and praised as natural. I said in the thread itself Hindus were far more lenient on this than say Muslims or Christians.
@deuterokerios @AASI_Amsha Where did you seriously hear this from? Your sources are absolutely incorrect. Iberians have about 10% WHG easily,  much higher than the rest of Europe. Not counting the WHG in EEF.
@SaffronMonke @hhrobbstark Yeah, Nairs and Tulus are. Vellalars or  Kammas are much more different. Nairs are like Brahmins in their genetics.
@RichardHanania It’s because Indian diaspora in the US is on the same socioeconomic rung of the ladder as the native White elite, and this diaspora loves emulating White liberals (who disproportionately form your elite ruling class). So better question is to ask why White women are so liberal.
@hhrobbstark What I’m implying is Steppe ancestry is so irrelevant for South India that you can remove it and nothing would change. I mean that Steppe MLBA ancestry had minimal impact on Dravidian speakers.
